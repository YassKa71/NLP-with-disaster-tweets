# NLP-with-disaster-tweets
This project aims to find a solution to the "" Kaggle Competition. It's a good initiation to NLP techniques.

## Problem description
witter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).
But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster.

In this competition, we’re challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. You’ll have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified.
